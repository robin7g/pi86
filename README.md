This is the code for my 8088/8086 (Really V20/V30) Raspberry Pi "hat"

https://www.homebrew8088.com/home/raspberry-pi-second-project



The code is fairly simple and easy to modify. Basically the Raspberry PI toggles the Clock then reads the Control Bus and then provides the 8088 what it is requesting. It will read the ALE pin and save the address then provide the proper Memory or IO Read/Write.  

**Disadvantages:**

The speed, the processor is only running at about 0.3 MHz the best I could calculate.  But on the flip side the drive read writes are very fast because the memory is virtual on raspberry pi.

Not all 8088/8086 Processors will work. The power is connected to the 3.3v pin on the PI. Most NEC V20/V30's will operate 3V - 7V so this is not problem.   

I have written a c library that helps with interfacing the 8088 PCB.  I have also begun to develop a GUI window that emulates CGA/VGA graphics. I tested this with a fresh install of Raspberry PI os and it ran just fine.

### Prerequisites 
To compile you need build tools, SDL2 and nasm
```
sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install nasm
```

### Build
```
cd src
make
```

### Run
For the **V30 CPU** 8086 run 
```
sudo pi86
```
For the **V20 CPU** 8088 run
```
sudo pi88
```



*** This is experimental use at your own risk. 

This current build runs very stable. I have left it running for seveal hours and came back and it was still running just fine. I encourage you to download the source code to the projects and give them a try and make modification.
